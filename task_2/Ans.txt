Task 2: You are working on a dashboard using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. The dashboard
displays data charts which are fetched from a REST API. However, the charts are not updating
in real-time as new data arrives from the API.



Question: How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue ensuring the charts update in
real-time as the data changes? Explain your approach, potential challenges and the overall
thought process.


Answer:

First Verify Data Flow and Confirm data is fetched correctly from the API. If the problem is not resolve than
we can use this library to update realtime when data are changes.

1. WebSocket or Server-Sent Events: 
If the API supports it, consider using WebSocket 
or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates. These technologies allow the server to
push data to the client when it changes.

2. Use Realtime-chart-library:
Ensure that the charting library we are using supports dynamic updates. 
Some charting libraries require explicit calls to update or redraw charts when the underlying data changes.


By following this approach, We can identify potential issues and implement a solution that allows your ReactJS and Tailwind CSS dashboard to update the charts in real-time as new data arrives from the API.
